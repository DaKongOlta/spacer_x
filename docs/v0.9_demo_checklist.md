# v0.9.0 "DEMO" Delivery Checklist

This checklist tracks the large push toward the planned demo build. Each section mirrors the agreed release pillars so we can mark progress and line up follow-up work.

## 1. Race-Control State Machine
- [x] GREEN → YELLOW → SAFETY → RESTART sequencing implemented in `setRacePhase` with banner/audio hooks.
- [x] Restart hold and "No Overtake before Line" gate enforced via restart timers and caution order audits.
- [ ] Tighten automated regression coverage for state transitions (smoke harness + manual checklist update).
- [x] Surface violation logs (jump start, overtake under yellow) in the Codex archive timeline.

## 2. Start Procedures & Grid
- [x] Standing, staggered, and rolling start options with light-stack overlays and marshal animations.
- [x] Jump-start detection and ticker warnings when cars creep during countdown.
- [x] Add replay bookmarks for formation laps and release moments.
- [x] Profile alternative camera sweeps for grid presentation.

## 3. TV / Broadcast UI v2
- [x] Permanent leaderboard with gap trends, focus-halo minimap markers, and incident/overtake banners.
- [x] Sector split widget with PB/FL colours and ticker integration.
- [x] Extend highlight ticker to show safety-lap counters and pit-stop summaries.
- [x] Add compact timing-page modal for deep-dive stats.

## 4. Track System & Content
- [x] Circuit roster expanded with Solstice Ridge, Helix Spires, Mirage Hyperloop, Nebula Nexus, Atlas Skyway, Fracture Belt, and Lumen Cascades.
- [x] Finalise `tracks.json` schema + loader to decouple data from runtime bundle.
- [x] Introduce canyon sprint & city GP layouts with bespoke minimap assets.
- [x] Gate weather presets per track inside the new data schema.

## 5. AI & Vehicle Behaviour
- [x] Vehicle archetype randomiser influencing straight/corner/system performance at season boot.
- [x] Promote AI state machine (ATTACK / DEFEND / CONSERVE / FOLLOW_SC) into dedicated module with tuning hooks.
- [x] Generate per-driver risk windows for overtakes vs. defensive holds.
- [x] Record incident attribution for Codex archives.

## 6. Manager / Career Mode
- [x] Weekly simulation loop with facilities, contracts, transfer market, and morale/budget effects.
- [ ] Layer sponsor targets & payouts into the weekly summary.
- [ ] Persist season history + champion records to the archive view.
- [ ] Draft onboarding flow for creating a custom team profile.

## 7. Special Modes & Betting
- [x] Betting challenge stub with odds, balance tracking, and payout settlement.
- [ ] Introduce multi-bet slips and per-player couch mode toggles.
- [ ] Add betting history graph + export option.

## 8. Presentation & Audio
- [x] Title theme trigger with fade controls and menu hero scene.
- [x] Broadcast intro, grid briefing, and marshal countdown overlays in Neo-Noir styling.
- [x] Commission/ingest SFX set for safety car deploy, restart release, and finish fanfare.
- [x] Add accessibility toggles (reduced motion, high contrast) for presentation layers.

## 9. Save/Load & Tooling
- [x] Profile export/import with sanitisation for manager, GP, betting, and UI preferences.
- [ ] Versioned GP/Manager saves with migration guards.
- [ ] Smoke-test harness that boots quick race, GP round, and manager week in headless mode.
- [ ] Performance budget capture (performance.now sampling + dev overlay).

**Next Step Focus:** regression tooling for race-control phases, track JSON loader prototype, and AI state refactor. These three unlock faster iteration on the remaining checklist items.
